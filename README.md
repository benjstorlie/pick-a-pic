# Pick-a-Pic

## Concept

Pick-a-Pick is a small application to pick from selections of pictures. The user searches for pictures, presents options to the intended user with a disability or language barrier, and the choice is communicated clearly using the application.

### As a Person with a Speech Disability (and/or Cognitive, Physical, etc. Disability)
```
I want to be able to see a page with images that is simple to understand and free of distraction.
I want to touch an image and have its title be spoken aloud
To have audible feedback
So I know what this image is supposed to be representing in this context
So I can communicate to someone further away
I want the screen to stay constant and not change away from the page if I am not precise with my movements.
```


### As an Educator
``` I want to be able to quickly make a page with images or symbols to present to a student.
I want to utilize an image search engine to choose an image to go in each card.
I want to be able to save pages I’ve made to open later.
I don’t want to spend a lot of time learning how to use a new web app.
When presenting a page to a student, I don’t want them to be able to mess it up.
I want this app to be functional on a touch-screen device, such as an iPad or Smartboard.
For each image card
I want to add a title that will be spoken aloud
I want to be able to type in image search terms and select a particular image
I want to be able to add an image card to a page that acts as a heading, for a question or start of a sentence.
I want to have a homepage that displays multiple ready-made and custom pages, to choose from to deploy in different circumstances.

## Directions for Future Development
* More options for how to include images, like uploading your own.
* How to share a page with others, like cloud storage, or a unique link.
* Include templates and sample pages with common usage.
* See if there is a way to connect it to Boardmaker or SymbolStix’s databases of symbols designed for communication.  The user would have to log in to have access.
